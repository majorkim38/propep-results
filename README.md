Attempt at creating database of solid propellants
Everything here is calculated using Dave Cooper's ProPep 3 v1.0.3, version of the PROPEP termochemical code. 
ProPep 3 is freely available at: https://www.rimworld.com/loggerusb/propep3/intro.html
A guide on how to use GUIPEP can be found at Richard Nakka's amazing website: http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_prope.html
Note: due to unknown reasons, ProPep 3 doesn't calculate the density, despite having all the required data in PEPCODED.DAF
