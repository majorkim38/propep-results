Attempt at creating database of solid rocket propellants

The plan is to create sortable tables for easy comparison of propellants

Everything here is calculated using Dave Cooper's ProPep 3 v1.0.3, version of the PROPEP termochemical code. 

ProPep 3 is freely available at: https://www.rimworld.com/loggerusb/propep3/intro.html

A guide on how to use GUIPEP can be found at Richard Nakka's amazing website: http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_prope.html

Note: due to unknown reasons, ProPep 3 doesn't calculate the density, despite having all the required data in PEPCODED.DAF

For the ease of comparison, everything (unless noted) is calculated at standard conditions:

Pressure in combustion chamber: 68.02 atm (~6.9 MPa, 1000 psi)

STP conditions outside: 298 K, 1 atm (101325 Pa, 14.7 psi)

Note: PROPEP was developed in backwards country and uses psi as unit of pressure
